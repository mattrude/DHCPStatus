package Line_print;

#
# This package allows plain text to be written line-by-line, in a controlled
# way.  In particular, we keep track of how many characters of text are
# written, and compare it with our output line width, to make sure that
# stuff doesn't wrap over a line in an ugly way.
# This package is used by the display_line.pm module.  Its worth noting here
# that display_line.pm makes use of the Term::ReadKey module if its installed
# to determine how wide the output should be.  If Term::ReadKey isn't installed,
# then display_line.pm reads the width from the dhcpstatus.ini file.
